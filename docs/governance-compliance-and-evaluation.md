## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance on evaluating customer needs, internal customer needs, governance requirements, and compliance requirements. It is intended for use by teams responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining cloud workloads and services. The purpose is to ensure that workloads and services meet business objectives while adhering to governance and compliance standards.

## Evaluate customer needs

### Why it's important

Understanding and meeting customer needs is critical for delivering value and ensuring customer satisfaction. By evaluating customer needs, organizations can:

- Align products and services with customer expectations
- Identify opportunities for innovation and improvement  
- Prioritize development efforts
- Increase customer retention and loyalty

### Implementation guidance

- Involve key stakeholders including business, development, and operations teams
- Work backwards from desired customer outcomes
- Use mechanisms like surveys, interviews, and analytics to capture customer needs
- Engage customers directly to validate needs and proposed solutions
- Create feedback loops to continuously reassess needs as they evolve

### Additional considerations

- Balance customer desires with business objectives and technical feasibility
- Account for both functional and non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, reliability)
- Consider needs of different customer segments
- Look for unstated or future needs, not just current explicit needs

## Evaluate internal customer needs  

### Why it's important

Internal customers (e.g. other teams, departments) often rely on shared services and infrastructure. Understanding their needs is crucial for:

- Enabling productivity across the organization
- Aligning IT/operations with business goals
- Optimizing resource allocation
- Fostering collaboration between teams

### Implementation guidance

- Identify key internal stakeholders and customers
- Conduct regular meetings and surveys to gather requirements
- Analyze support tickets and requests to identify common needs
- Create internal SLAs and measure performance against them
- Implement self-service capabilities where possible

### Additional considerations

- Balance needs of different internal customers
- Consider impact on external customers
- Look for opportunities to standardize and consolidate
- Educate internal customers on costs and tradeoffs

## Evaluate governance requirements

### Why it's important

Governance provides the framework for ensuring that IT and cloud initiatives:

- Align with business strategy and objectives  
- Comply with policies and regulations
- Manage risk appropriately
- Optimize resource utilization
- Maintain consistency and standards

### Implementation guidance

- Work with leadership to define governance principles and policies
- Implement governance processes (e.g. architecture review boards)
- Use tools like AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies to enforce governance 
- Conduct regular audits and assessments
- Provide governance training and documentation

### Additional considerations

- Balance governance with agility - avoid overly restrictive policies
- Adapt governance for cloud vs traditional IT
- Consider governance across multi-cloud and hybrid environments
- Leverage automation to enforce and validate governance

## Evaluate compliance requirements

### Why it's important

Meeting compliance requirements is essential to:

- Maintain regulatory compliance and avoid penalties
- Protect sensitive data and systems
- Build trust with customers and partners
- Enable business in regulated industries
- Reduce risk of security breaches and data loss

### Implementation guidance

- Identify applicable compliance standards (e.g. HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR)
- Map compliance controls to cloud services and configurations
- Implement monitoring and logging to demonstrate compliance
- Conduct regular compliance audits and penetration tests
- Use compliance automation tools and managed services where possible

### Additional considerations 

- Design for compliance from the start - don't bolt on afterwards
- Stay up to date as compliance standards evolve
- Consider compliance impacts when evaluating new services/features
- Balance compliance with usability and innovation
- Leverage cloud provider compliance programs and documentation

#  Governance, Compliance, and Evaluation

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance on evaluating customer needs, internal customer needs, governance requirements, and compliance requirements. It is intended for use by teams responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining cloud workloads and services. The purpose is to ensure that workloads and services meet business objectives, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices.

## Evaluate customer needs

### Why it's important

Understanding and meeting customer needs is critical for delivering successful products and services. Evaluating customer needs allows you to:

- Align development efforts with customer priorities
- Identify opportunities for new features or improvements  
- Increase customer satisfaction and retention
- Make data-driven decisions about product direction

### Implementation guidance

- Involve key stakeholders including business, development, and operations teams in evaluating customer needs
- Use multiple methods to gather customer feedback:
  - Surveys and questionnaires 
  - User testing and interviews
  - Analytics and usage data
  - Customer support tickets
  - Sales and account management feedback
- Analyze both quantitative and qualitative data to identify trends and priorities
- Create user personas and journey maps to understand different customer segments
- Regularly review and update your understanding of customer needs as the market evolves
- Establish processes to incorporate customer feedback into product planning and development

### Additional considerations

- Balance customer requests with business strategy and technical feasibility  
- Look for underlying needs beyond surface-level feature requests
- Consider both current and potential future customers
- Evaluate needs across the entire customer lifecycle, not just initial purchase
- Prioritize needs based on impact and alignment with business goals

## Evaluate internal customer needs

### Why it's important

Internal customers - teams and individuals within your organization - have needs that must be met for the overall success of your products and services. Evaluating internal customer needs allows you to:

- Improve cross-team collaboration and efficiency
- Identify and resolve internal bottlenecks and pain points
- Ensure teams have the tools and resources needed to succeed
- Align internal processes with external customer needs

### Implementation guidance

- Identify key internal stakeholders and customers across functions
- Conduct regular surveys and feedback sessions with internal teams
- Analyze internal support tickets and requests
- Review internal processes and workflows to identify inefficiencies  
- Create internal personas and journey maps
- Establish feedback loops between teams
- Prioritize internal needs based on impact to external customers and business goals

### Additional considerations

- Balance needs of different internal teams which may sometimes conflict
- Consider both short-term tactical needs and long-term strategic needs
- Look for opportunities to standardize and streamline internal processes
- Evaluate impact of internal changes on external customers
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement and internal customer focus

## Evaluate governance requirements

### Why it's important

Governance provides the framework for ensuring that IT and cloud initiatives align with business objectives and comply with policies and regulations. Evaluating governance requirements allows you to:

- Ensure alignment between IT initiatives and business strategy
- Manage risk and compliance effectively
- Optimize resource allocation and investments
- Improve decision-making and accountability
- Enhance overall performance and value delivery

### Implementation guidance

- Identify key governance stakeholders across IT, business, legal, and compliance teams
- Review existing governance frameworks and policies
- Assess current governance maturity and gaps
- Define governance objectives aligned with business goals
- Establish governance structures, processes, and controls
- Implement governance tools and technologies 
- Create metrics to measure governance effectiveness
- Regularly review and update governance approach

### Additional considerations

- Balance governance controls with agility and innovation
- Ensure governance is embedded in processes, not just an afterthought
- Consider governance implications of new technologies and cloud services
- Align governance approach with industry standards and best practices
- Foster a culture of governance awareness across the organization

## Evaluate compliance requirements

### Why it's important

Compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards is critical for managing risk and maintaining trust. Evaluating compliance requirements allows you to:

- Avoid penalties and legal issues
- Protect sensitive data and assets
- Maintain customer and partner trust
- Improve security posture
- Streamline audits and certifications

### Implementation guidance

- Identify applicable compliance requirements (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
- Assess current compliance status and gaps
- Implement controls and processes to meet compliance requirements
- Use compliance frameworks and tools to streamline management
- Conduct regular internal audits and assessments
- Maintain documentation of compliance efforts
- Train employees on compliance responsibilities
- Establish processes for ongoing compliance monitoring

### Additional considerations

- Stay up-to-date on evolving compliance landscape
- Consider compliance implications when adopting new technologies
- Balance compliance needs with business agility and innovation
- Look for opportunities to automate compliance processes
- Align compliance efforts with broader risk management strategy
- Foster a culture of compliance awareness across the organization

By thoroughly evaluating customer needs, internal customer needs, governance requirements, and compliance requirements, organizations can ensure their cloud workloads and services deliver maximum value while managing risk effectively. Regular reassessment of these areas is critical as business needs and regulatory landscapes evolve.

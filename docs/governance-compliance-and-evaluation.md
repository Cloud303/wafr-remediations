## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance on evaluating customer needs, internal customer needs, governance requirements, and compliance requirements. It is intended for use by teams responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining cloud workloads and services. The purpose is to ensure that workloads and services meet business objectives, comply with regulations and policies, and satisfy both external and internal customer requirements.

## Evaluate customer needs

### Why it's important

Understanding and meeting external customer needs is critical for:

- Delivering value and ensuring customer satisfaction
- Aligning technical capabilities with business outcomes
- Prioritizing development efforts and resources
- Identifying opportunities for innovation and improvement

### Implementation guidance

- Involve key stakeholders including business, development, and operations teams
- Review business goals, needs, and priorities of external customers
- Establish a shared understanding of how operational practices support business outcomes
- Work backwards from desired customer outcomes
- Implement mechanisms to capture customer feedback and requirements
- Regularly review and validate that customer needs are being met

### Additional considerations

- Use data and metrics to measure how well customer needs are being addressed
- Implement processes to rapidly iterate and improve based on customer feedback
- Consider both functional and non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, reliability)
- Look for opportunities to exceed customer expectations and deliver additional value

## Evaluate internal customer needs  

### Why it's important

Understanding internal customer needs helps:

- Align teams and priorities across the organization
- Improve operational efficiency and effectiveness  
- Identify opportunities for automation and process improvement
- Ensure internal teams have the tools and capabilities they need

### Implementation guidance

- Engage key internal stakeholders including business, development, and operations teams
- Review business goals, needs, and priorities of internal customers
- Establish shared understanding of how internal teams support each other
- Implement mechanisms to gather feedback from internal teams
- Regularly review internal SLAs and metrics
- Look for opportunities to reduce toil and improve productivity

### Additional considerations

- Foster a culture of internal customer service across teams
- Implement self-service capabilities where possible
- Automate routine tasks to free up time for higher-value work
- Conduct regular surveys or interviews with internal teams

## Evaluate governance requirements

### Why it's important

Proper governance helps:

- Ensure compliance with organizational policies and standards  
- Manage risk and maintain security
- Provide guardrails for teams to operate efficiently
- Enable auditability and traceability

### Implementation guidance

- Work with stakeholders to identify governance requirements
- Review regulatory and compliance obligations
- Define policies, standards, and controls
- Implement governance as code where possible
- Use tools like AWS Config and AWS Organizations to enforce policies
- Regularly audit and review governance implementation
- Update governance as business needs and regulatory landscape evolves

### Additional considerations

- Balance governance with team autonomy and agility
- Implement least-privilege access controls
- Use automation to reduce human error in governance processes
- Maintain documentation of governance policies and controls

## Evaluate compliance requirements

### Why it's important

Meeting compliance requirements is critical for:

- Maintaining regulatory compliance and avoiding penalties
- Protecting customer data and privacy
- Enabling business in regulated industries
- Building trust with customers and partners

### Implementation guidance

- Identify applicable compliance frameworks (e.g. HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR)
- Review specific compliance controls and requirements
- Assess current compliance gaps
- Implement required security and privacy controls  
- Use compliance-as-code to automate checks
- Conduct regular compliance audits and assessments
- Maintain documentation and evidence of compliance

### Additional considerations

- Stay up-to-date on evolving compliance landscape
- Implement data governance and classification
- Use encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data
- Leverage compliance accelerators and pre-configured environments
- Consider third-party audits to validate compliance

By following this guidance, teams can ensure their workloads and services meet customer needs, align with business objectives, and satisfy governance and compliance requirements. Regular review and iteration of these processes is key to maintaining alignment as needs evolve over time.

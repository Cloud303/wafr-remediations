#  AWS Budget Deployment Guide

## Benefits of AWS Budget Deployment

Setting up AWS Budgets provides several key advantages:

- **Cost Control**: Get early warnings when spending approaches defined thresholds
- **Financial Planning**: Track costs against monthly, quarterly or annual budgets
- **Automated Monitoring**: Receive email notifications without manual tracking
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Monitor all cost types including credits, support, taxes etc.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Set notification thresholds that match your risk tolerance

## Quick Start

1. Access the budget template [here](https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/monitoring/budgets.yml)

2. Deploy via AWS Console:
   - Open CloudFormation
   - Click "Create Stack" 
   - Choose "With new resources (standard)"
   - Upload template file or specify template URL

3. Configure Parameters:
   ```
   pAmount: Your budget amount (required)
   pTimeUnit: MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY
   pNotificationThreshold: Percentage for alerts (default 80)
   pNotificationEmail: Email for notifications (required)
   ```

4. Review and create stack

## Verification

After deployment:

1. Navigate to AWS Billing Console
2. Select "Budgets" from left menu  
3. Verify budget appears with correct:
   - Amount
   - Time period
   - Notification settings
   - Email recipient

## Maintenance

- Budget will automatically reset based on chosen time unit
- Notifications will send when spending exceeds threshold
- Update stack parameters if budget amounts need adjustment
- Delete stack to remove budget and notifications

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- Invalid email format - Ensure email is correctly formatted
- Missing permissions - Verify IAM permissions for budget creation
- Failed notifications - Check email spam filters

For additional support, refer to AWS Budgets documentation.

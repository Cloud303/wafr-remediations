#  Deploying an OpenVPN Server on AWS Using CloudFormation

## Benefits of Deployment

Deploying an OpenVPN server using this CloudFormation template offers several advantages:

1. **Quick and Easy Setup**: Rapidly deploy a fully configured OpenVPN server without manual installation steps.
2. **Cost-Effective**: Utilizes ARM64 (Graviton) processors, which can provide better price-performance compared to x86 instances.
3. **Secure Configuration**: Includes pre-configured security groups and IAM roles for enhanced security.
4. **Scalability**: Easily adjustable instance types to match your performance needs.
5. **High Availability**: Optional auto-recovery feature ensures your VPN server stays operational.
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Optional DataDog monitoring tag for seamless integration with your existing monitoring setup.
7. **Customizable**: Easily modifiable to suit specific requirements or organizational standards.

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create CloudFormation stacks and associated resources.
- A VPC and subnet where you want to deploy the OpenVPN server.
- An EC2 key pair for secure access to the instance.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Access the Template**
   
   Download or copy the CloudFormation template from the following link:
   [OpenVPN Server CloudFormation Template](https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/ec2/ec2-openvpn.yml)

2. **Launch CloudFormation Stack**
   
   - Open the AWS CloudFormation console.
   - Click "Create stack" and choose "With new resources (standard)".
   - Upload the template file or provide the template URL.

3. **Configure Stack Parameters**
   
   Fill in the required parameters:
   - VPC ID and CIDR
   - EC2 instance type (t4g.micro or t4g.small recommended)
   - EC2 key pair name
   - Subnet ID for deployment
   - OpenVPN admin password
   - Enable/disable EC2 auto-recovery
   - Enable/disable DataDog monitoring
   - Environment tag

4. **Review and Create Stack**
   
   - Review the stack details and estimated costs.
   - Acknowledge that the stack might create IAM resources.
   - Click "Create stack" to initiate the deployment.

5. **Monitor Stack Creation**
   
   - Wait for the stack creation to complete. This typically takes a few minutes.
   - If any issues occur, check the "Events" tab for error messages.

6. **Access OpenVPN Server**
   
   - Once the stack creation is complete, go to the "Outputs" tab.
   - Note the "OpenVPN Server URL" value. This is the Elastic IP address assigned to your server.
   - Use this URL to access the OpenVPN Access Server admin interface.

7. **Configure OpenVPN Clients**
   
   - Log in to the OpenVPN Access Server admin interface using the password you specified during stack creation.
   - Follow the OpenVPN documentation to set up and distribute client configurations.

### Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Security Hardening**: Review and adjust the security group rules if necessary.
2. **Monitoring Setup**: If you enabled DataDog monitoring, ensure your DataDog agent is properly configured.
3. **Backup Planning**: Consider setting up regular backups of your OpenVPN configuration.
4. **Update Management**: Plan for regular updates of the Ubuntu OS and OpenVPN software.

By following this guide, you'll have a fully functional OpenVPN server deployed on AWS, ready to secure your remote access needs.

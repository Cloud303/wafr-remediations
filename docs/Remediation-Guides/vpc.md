#  VPC Infrastructure Deployment Guide

This guide walks through deploying a highly available and secure VPC infrastructure using CloudFormation. The template creates a production-ready VPC with public, private and data subnets across multiple Availability Zones.

## Benefits

- **High Availability**: Deploy across up to 4 AZs for maximum redundancy and fault tolerance
- **Security**: Private subnets and NACLs protect sensitive workloads from direct internet access
- **Cost Optimization**: NAT Gateways only in AZs where needed
- **Performance**: VPC Endpoints for S3 and ECR reduce data transfer costs and latency
- **Flexibility**: Customizable CIDR ranges and subnet configurations
- **Monitoring**: Built-in VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis
- **Automation**: Infrastructure as code for consistent deployments

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create VPC resources
- Basic understanding of VPC networking concepts
- AWS CLI or Console access

## Deployment Steps

1. Download the CloudFormation template:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/vpc/vpc.yml
   ```

2. Navigate to the CloudFormation console in your desired region

3. Click "Create Stack" and upload the template file

4. Configure the stack parameters:
   - Select number of Availability Zones (1-4)
   - Specify VPC CIDR range
   - Enable/disable private and data subnets
   - Configure DNS settings
   - Set VPC Flow Log retention
   - Enable required VPC Endpoints
   - Add environment tags

5. Review the configuration and create the stack

6. Monitor the stack creation progress (~10-15 minutes)

7. Once complete, note the exported outputs for use in other stacks

## Validation

After deployment, verify:

- Subnets are created in specified AZs
- Route tables are configured correctly
- NAT Gateways are operational
- VPC Endpoints are accessible
- Flow Logs are being generated

## Next Steps

- Deploy workloads into the private subnets
- Configure security groups for resources
- Set up VPN or Direct Connect for remote access
- Enable additional VPC Endpoints as needed
- Monitor VPC Flow Logs for security analysis

#  Deploying a Customizable VPC with CloudFormation

This guide will walk you through deploying a highly customizable VPC using a CloudFormation template. The template creates a robust network infrastructure with public, private, and data subnets across multiple Availability Zones, along with essential networking components like NAT Gateways, an Internet Gateway, and VPC endpoints.

## Benefits of Deploying This VPC

1. **Flexibility**: Customize the VPC to fit your specific needs with configurable parameters.
2. **High Availability**: Support for multiple Availability Zones ensures resilience.
3. **Security**: Includes Network ACLs and VPC Flow Logs for enhanced security and monitoring.
4. **Cost Optimization**: Optional components like NAT Gateways and VPC endpoints allow for cost control.
5. **Scalability**: The modular design allows for easy expansion as your needs grow.
6. **Compliance**: Helps meet various compliance requirements with isolated subnets and logging capabilities.

## Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Access the Template

The CloudFormation template can be found at:
[https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/vpc/vpc.yml](https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/vpc/vpc.yml)

### Step 2: Prepare for Deployment

1. Review the template and understand the parameters available.
2. Determine your requirements for:
   - Number of Availability Zones
   - CIDR blocks for VPC and subnets
   - Whether you need private and data subnets
   - VPC endpoint requirements
   - Custom DNS settings

### Step 3: Launch the CloudFormation Stack

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to CloudFormation.
2. Click "Create stack" and choose "With new resources (standard)".
3. Select "Upload a template file" and upload the template you downloaded.
4. Click "Next" to proceed to the parameter configuration.

### Step 4: Configure Stack Parameters

1. Enter a stack name.
2. Fill in the parameters according to your requirements:
   - Number of AZs
   - AZ names (if you have specific ones in mind)
   - VPC CIDR block
   - Subnet CIDR blocks
   - Enable/disable private and data subnets
   - Configure DNS settings
   - Set VPC Flow Log retention period
   - Choose VPC endpoint options
   - Add an Environment tag

### Step 5: Configure Stack Options

1. Add any additional tags if needed.
2. Set up any advanced options like stack policy or rollback configuration.
3. Click "Next" to review.

### Step 6: Review and Create Stack

1. Review all the settings and parameters.
2. Acknowledge any capabilities if prompted.
3. Click "Create stack" to begin deployment.

### Step 7: Monitor Deployment

1. Watch the stack creation progress in the CloudFormation console.
2. Check the "Events" tab for any issues during deployment.

### Step 8: Access Outputs

Once the stack creation is complete:
1. Go to the "Outputs" tab of your stack.
2. Note down or export the important values like VPC ID, Subnet IDs, etc.
3. These outputs can be used in other CloudFormation stacks or for manual resource creation.

### Step 9: Post-Deployment Steps

1. Verify the created resources in the VPC, EC2, and VPC Endpoints consoles.
2. Test connectivity between subnets if applicable.
3. Set up any additional security groups or network ACL rules as needed.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional, customized VPC ready for your applications and services. Remember to monitor your resources and adjust configurations as your needs evolve.

#  Guide: Deploying AWS Security Tools with CloudFormation

This guide walks through deploying a comprehensive set of AWS security tools using CloudFormation to enhance your AWS account's security posture.

## Benefits

Deploying these security tools provides:

- **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Track all API activity across regions with CloudTrail
- **Security Assessment** - Continuous security evaluation with GuardDuty and Inspector
- **Compliance** - Meet security requirements with Config tracking and HIPAA settings
- **Centralized Logs** - Encrypted logging to S3 with CloudWatch integration
- **Access Analysis** - Identify unintended resource access with IAM Access Analyzer
- **Automated Deployment** - Consistent security tool configuration via Infrastructure as Code

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create the required resources
- Email address for security notifications
- Understanding of your compliance requirements (e.g. HIPAA)

## Deployment Steps

1. Download the CloudFormation template from:
   [cloud303-aws-security-tools.yml](https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/security-tools/cloud303-aws-security-tools.yml)

2. Navigate to AWS CloudFormation in your desired region

3. Choose "Create Stack" and upload the template

4. Configure the parameters:

   ### Required Parameters
   - Security Email Endpoint
   - Environment Tag (production/development)

   ### Security Tool Settings
   - Enable/disable GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail, Inspector
   - Configure finding delivery frequencies
   - Set log retention periods
   - Enable HIPAA compliance settings if needed

5. Review the configuration and create the stack

6. Monitor stack creation progress (~15-20 minutes)

7. Once complete, verify the outputs show successful deployment

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. Verify CloudTrail logs are being delivered to S3
2. Check GuardDuty findings dashboard
3. Review Config rules and recordings
4. Test Inspector scanning
5. Examine Access Analyzer results

## Maintenance Tasks

- Regularly review security findings
- Update parameters as needed
- Monitor log storage usage
- Verify notification delivery
- Update IAM roles if permissions change

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
- Check IAM permissions
- Verify parameter values
- Review CloudFormation events
- Ensure service quotas aren't exceeded

## Security Best Practices

- Use encrypted parameters for sensitive values
- Review and restrict IAM roles to minimum required permissions
- Enable MFA for IAM users accessing security tools
- Regularly audit security findings and alerts

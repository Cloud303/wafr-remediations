#  Deploying AWS Security Tools with CloudFormation

This guide walks through deploying a comprehensive set of AWS security tools using CloudFormation to enhance your AWS account's security posture.

## Benefits

- **Centralized Security Monitoring**: Enables unified visibility across your AWS environment through CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and AWS Config
- **Automated Compliance**: Helps meet compliance requirements with HIPAA settings and encrypted logging
- **Threat Detection**: Provides advanced threat detection through GuardDuty and malware protection
- **Resource Analysis**: Identifies potential security risks with IAM Access Analyzer and Amazon Inspector
- **Simplified Deployment**: Deploy multiple security tools consistently with a single template

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions to create CloudFormation stacks
- Basic understanding of AWS security services
- Email address for security notifications

## Deployment Steps

1. Download the CloudFormation template from [here](https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/security-tools/cloud303-aws-security-tools.yml)

2. Log into the AWS Console and navigate to CloudFormation

3. Click "Create stack" and choose "With new resources"

4. Upload the template file

5. Configure the parameters:

   ### Required Parameters
   - Security email endpoint for notifications
   - Environment tag (production/development)

   ### Optional Security Features
   - GuardDuty settings (enable/disable, frequency, malware protection)
   - AWS Config settings (enable/disable, delivery frequency)
   - CloudTrail configuration (enable/disable, log retention)
   - Inspector settings (notifications, S3 export)
   - IAM Access Analyzer (enable/disable)
   - HIPAA compliance settings

6. Review the configuration and click "Create stack"

7. Monitor the stack creation progress in the CloudFormation console

8. Once complete, verify the deployment by checking:
   - CloudTrail logs in CloudWatch
   - GuardDuty findings dashboard
   - AWS Config rules
   - Inspector assessment results
   - Access Analyzer findings

## Post-Deployment

1. Confirm receipt of test notification email
2. Review any initial security findings
3. Configure additional alerting if needed
4. Document deployed security controls

## Maintenance

- Regularly review security findings
- Update parameters as needed through stack updates
- Monitor CloudWatch logs for issues
- Review Access Analyzer results monthly

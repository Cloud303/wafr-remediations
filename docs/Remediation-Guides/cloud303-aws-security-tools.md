#  Deploying AWS Security Tools with CloudFormation

This guide walks through deploying core AWS security services using a CloudFormation template. The template provides a streamlined way to enable essential security monitoring and compliance tools across your AWS environment.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Security Setup**: Deploy multiple security services in minutes instead of configuring each one manually
- **Consistent Configuration**: Ensure security tools are deployed with best practices and proper integrations
- **Compliance Ready**: Optional HIPAA compliance monitoring and conformance packs
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Consolidated security findings and logs in centralized S3 buckets
- **Cost Effective**: Enable only the security tools you need with flexible parameters

## Deployment Steps

1. Download the [AWS Security Tools Template](https://github.com/Cloud303/wafr-remediations/blob/main/cloudformation/security-tools/cloud303-aws-security-tools.yml)

2. Log into the AWS Console and navigate to CloudFormation

3. Click "Create Stack" and choose "With new resources"

4. Upload the template file

5. Configure the parameters based on your requirements:

   ### Essential Parameters
   - `pSecurityEmailEndpoint` - Email address for security notifications
   - `pEnvironmentTag` - Choose production or development
   
   ### Service Enablement
   - Enable/disable individual services (GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail, Inspector, Access Analyzer)
   - Configure service-specific settings like delivery frequency and retention periods
   
   ### Optional Features  
   - HIPAA compliance monitoring
   - Malware protection
   - Findings export to S3

6. Review the configuration and create the stack

7. Monitor the stack creation progress in the CloudFormation console

8. Once complete, check the Outputs tab for:
   - Service status confirmations
   - S3 bucket names for logs
   - CloudWatch log group details

## Post-Deployment

1. Verify you receive a subscription confirmation email for the SNS notifications

2. Check that services are running in their respective consoles

3. Review any initial findings in GuardDuty and Inspector

4. Configure additional alerting or automation based on findings as needed

## Maintenance

- Regularly review security findings through the configured SNS topics
- Monitor S3 storage usage for logs and findings
- Update parameters as needed through stack updates
- Review compliance pack findings if enabled

The template provides a foundation for AWS security monitoring that can be enhanced based on your specific requirements.

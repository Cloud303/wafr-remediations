#  Configure Data Lifecycle Manager for EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs

## Benefits
- Automates creation and management of EBS snapshots and AMIs on a defined schedule
- Ensures consistent backup policies across your AWS environment
- Reduces operational overhead by automatically deleting outdated backups
- Helps maintain business continuity and disaster recovery readiness
- Optimizes storage costs by removing unnecessary snapshots

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions
- EBS volumes and EC2 instances that need to be backed up
- IAM role for Data Lifecycle Manager with required permissions

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create IAM Role for Data Lifecycle Manager

1. Navigate to IAM console
2. Create new IAM role with the following trust relationship:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "dlm.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
3. Attach `AWSDataLifecycleManagerServiceRole` managed policy

### 2. Create Lifecycle Policy for EBS Snapshots

1. Open EC2 console and navigate to Lifecycle Manager
2. Click "Create lifecycle policy"
3. Select "EBS snapshot policy"
4. Configure policy details:
   - Description: Meaningful description of backup purpose
   - Resource type: Volume or Instance
   - Target resources: Select by tags
   - Add appropriate tags to identify resources
5. Configure schedule:
   - Set frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/custom)
   - Set start time
   - Set retention period
6. Enable cross-region copy if needed
7. Add tags to snapshots if required
8. Review and create policy

### 3. Create Lifecycle Policy for EBS-backed AMIs

1. In Lifecycle Manager, click "Create lifecycle policy"
2. Select "EBS-backed AMI policy"
3. Configure policy details:
   - Description: Meaningful description
   - Target resources: Select instances by tags
   - Add appropriate tags
4. Configure schedule:
   - Set frequency
   - Set start time
   - Set retention count
5. Configure AMI settings:
   - Enable cross-region copy if needed
   - Configure tags
   - Set reboot options
6. Review and create policy

### 4. Tag Resources

1. Identify volumes/instances for backup
2. Add tags matching lifecycle policy criteria
3. Verify tags are applied correctly

### 5. Monitor and Verify

1. Check Data Lifecycle Manager dashboard for policy status
2. Verify snapshots/AMIs are created according to schedule
3. Confirm retention policies are working
4. Monitor AWS CloudWatch metrics for DLM activities

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive tags for easy resource identification
- Set appropriate retention periods based on business needs
- Regular audit of backup policies and retention rules
- Monitor storage costs associated with snapshots/AMIs
- Document backup and retention requirements
- Test restore procedures periodically

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Policy not creating backups: Check IAM permissions and resource tags
- Snapshots not being deleted: Verify retention rules
- High costs: Review retention periods and unnecessary snapshots
- Failed operations: Check CloudWatch logs for error messages

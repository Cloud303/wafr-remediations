#  Continuous Improvement and Knowledge Management

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines processes for continuous improvement and knowledge management within the organization. The intended audience is all employees, with a focus on operations, development, and leadership teams.

The purpose of this SOP is to establish standardized practices for:

- Continuously improving processes, procedures, and systems through structured feedback loops and analysis
- Managing organizational knowledge and learnings in a systematic way
- Ensuring improvements and knowledge are shared effectively across teams

- Document potential improvements identified through assessments and feedback
- Prioritize improvements based on:
  - Business impact and value
  - Level of effort required
  - Risk assessment
  - Dependencies and prerequisites

#### 3. Plan and Implement Improvements
- Define clear objectives and success criteria for improvements
- Create detailed implementation plans
- Allocate necessary resources and budget
- Execute improvements using project management best practices
- Track progress and status

#### 4. Measure Results

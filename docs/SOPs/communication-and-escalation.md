#  Communication and Escalation

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines best practices for communication and escalation 
within the organization. It is intended for all employees, managers, and leaders to ensure clear, 
effective communication and appropriate escalation of issues.

The primary audience for this SOP includes:

- Executive leadership and management
- Team leads and managers
- Individual contributors
- Support and operations teams

## Provide Executive Sponsorship

### Why It's Important

Executive sponsorship is critical for establishing clear expectations and direction for organizational 
outcomes. When executive leadership actively sets direction, assigns ownership, takes accountability, 
and defines work, individuals across the organization can mobilize effectively toward desired 
objectives.

### Implementation Guidance

Executive sponsors should:

- Clearly communicate and share vision, direction and goals so team members know what is expected
- Set expectations by defining and publishing measurable goals
- Track achievement of goals regularly and share results
- Provide necessary resources by bringing people and teams together to collaborate
- Advocate for teams by understanding their performance and external factors affecting them
- Drive adoption of best practices by acknowledging quantifiable benefits
- Encourage evolution by creating a culture of continuous improvement

### Best Practices

- Have a designated primary executive sponsor to lead and drive transformation
- Define clear business outcomes and assign ownership/accountability
- Establish clearly defined business objectives for initiatives
- Document key business metrics to drive transformation
- Communicate vision consistently to all teams
- Set and manage expectations through regular in-person events
- Accept feedback on communications effectiveness
- Schedule regular communication events to understand challenges
- Actively engage initiatives to verify teams understand outcomes
- Look for blockers, inspect metrics, and measure progress in status meetings

## Escalation is Encouraged

### Why It's Important

Team members must be encouraged to escalate issues and concerns to higher-level decision makers 
when they believe desired outcomes are at risk. This should be a core feature of organizational 
culture driven at all levels. Early and frequent escalation helps identify and prevent issues 
before they cause incidents.

### Implementation Guidance

To implement effective escalation:

- Define policies requiring teams to have effective plans to reverse changes within specified periods
- Analyze impact level of all changes related to workload components
- Allow repeatable changes to be standardized and pre-authorized if following consistent workflows
- Reduce potential impact by making changes smaller so recovery takes less time
- Integrate tools and workflows to enforce policies programmatically
- Make change data visible to improve diagnosis speed
- Use monitoring to verify deployment success/failure
- Measure outage duration to improve recovery plans

### Best Practices

- Document escalation policies, standards and expectations
- Train and empower workers for early/frequent escalation
- Build mechanisms for escalation like Andon cord systems
- Have documented procedures for when/how to escalate
- Define series of people with increasing authority
- Protect employees who escalate from retribution
- Encourage continuous improvement feedback loops
- Leadership should periodically reemphasize policies

## Communications are Timely, Clear, and Actionable

### Why It's Important

Leadership must create strong and effective communications, especially when adopting new strategies, 
technologies or ways of working. Clear communication ensures teams remain informed and motivated to 
work together rather than against each other.

### Implementation Guidance

To implement effective communications:

- Establish core team accountable for communication plans
- Institute single-threaded ownership for oversight
- Work with stakeholders to agree on standards and practices
- Craft messages appropriate for staff
- Build strategic mechanisms like announcements, calendars, meetings
- Provide necessary context, details and time for action
- Implement tools for tactical communications
- Measure effectiveness of communications
- Establish feedback loops
- Set up alternate contacts for accounts
- Have escalation and reverse escalation plans
- Prioritize repeatable actions for automation
- Analyze communications from alert systems

### Best Practices

- Design communication strategies to address impact of change
- Ensure individuals understand importance of their role
- Use email as passive mechanism only
- Management spends time with individuals to explain responsibilities
- Leaders engage directly in smaller venues when needed
- Encourage diverse opinions and perspectives
- Expand roles and responsibilities
- Provide safe and welcoming environment
- Support team member participation

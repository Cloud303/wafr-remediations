#  Incident Management and Planning

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance on establishing and maintaining an effective incident management program for cloud workloads. The intended audience includes security teams, incident responders, cloud administrators, and application teams responsible for responding to and recovering from security incidents.

The SOP covers key aspects of incident management including identifying key personnel and resources, developing incident response plans, and regularly assessing security controls. Following these procedures helps ensure consistent and effective response to security incidents while minimizing business impact.

## Identify Key Personnel and External Resources

### Overview
Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities is critical for effective incident response. This section outlines how to identify and document key personnel and external resources needed during security incidents.

### Key Personnel Roles

The following key roles should be identified and documented:

- **Incident Manager**: Has overall authority during incident response
- **Incident Responders**: Responsible for investigation and remediation activities
- **Communications Lead**: Handles internal and external communications
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Provide expertise on impacted systems and applications

For each role:
- Document primary and backup contacts with multiple contact methods
- Define clear responsibilities and authority levels
- Establish escalation paths when personnel are unavailable
- Review and update contact information regularly

### External Resources

Identify and document external parties that may be needed:

- AWS Support contacts and support plan details
- Third-party security vendors and consultants  
- Legal counsel
- PR/Communications firms
- Law enforcement contacts
- Regulatory bodies that need to be notified

Maintain updated contact information and engagement procedures for all external resources.

### Implementation Steps

1. Create and maintain contact lists with:
   - Names and roles
   - Multiple contact methods (phone, email, etc)
   - Escalation procedures
   - Response time expectations

2. Document engagement procedures for external resources:
   - Support contract details
   - SLAs and response times
   - Methods for engaging support
   - Required information for support requests

3. Regularly review and update:
   - Contact information accuracy
   - Role assignments
   - External resource contracts/agreements
   - Notification requirements

4. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager to:
   - Manage contacts and on-call schedules
   - Define response plans
   - Create escalation paths
   - Track incidents

## Develop Incident Management Plans

### Overview
A comprehensive incident management plan provides the foundation for responding to and recovering from security incidents. The plan should document processes, procedures and playbooks for handling different types of incidents.

### Plan Components

The incident management plan should include:

1. Incident Response Team Overview
   - Team structure and organization
   - Roles and responsibilities 
   - Training requirements
   - Communication procedures

2. Incident Classification Framework
   - Severity levels and definitions
   - Impact assessment criteria
   - Prioritization guidelines
   - Escalation thresholds

3. Response Procedures
   - Initial assessment and triage
   - Investigation processes
   - Containment strategies
   - Eradication procedures
   - Recovery steps
   - Post-incident activities

4. Communication Plans
   - Internal notification procedures
   - External communication guidelines
   - Stakeholder management
   - Status reporting requirements

5. Documentation Requirements
   - Incident logging procedures
   - Evidence handling guidelines
   - Chain of custody processes
   - Post-incident reporting

### Implementation Steps

1. Document incident response procedures:
   - Create detailed playbooks for common scenarios
   - Define clear roles and responsibilities
   - Establish communication protocols
   - Set documentation standards

2. Test and validate plans through:
   - Tabletop exercises
   - Simulated incidents
   - After-action reviews
   - Plan updates based on lessons learned

3. Maintain and update plans:
   - Regular review cycles
   - Incorporation of lessons learned
   - Updates for new threats/risks
   - Testing of changes

4. Train personnel on plans:
   - Initial training for new team members
   - Regular refresher training
   - Scenario-based exercises
   - Documentation of training

## Regularly Assess Security Properties of the Pipelines

### Overview
The security of deployment pipelines is critical for maintaining the integrity of applications and infrastructure. Regular assessment helps identify vulnerabilities and ensures controls remain effective.

### Key Assessment Areas

1. Access Controls
   - IAM roles and permissions
   - Secrets management
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Authorization policies

2. Pipeline Configuration
   - Build environments
   - Testing frameworks
   - Deployment processes
   - Change management

3. Security Controls
   - Code scanning
   - Vulnerability testing
   - Compliance checks
   - Audit logging

### Implementation Steps

1. Establish assessment schedule:
   - Regular security reviews
   - Automated scanning
   - Manual testing
   - Third-party assessments

2. Define assessment criteria:
   - Security requirements
   - Compliance standards
   - Best practices
   - Risk thresholds

3. Document findings and remediation:
   - Issue tracking
   - Remediation plans
   - Verification testing
   - Metrics collection

4. Review and improve:
   - Update security controls
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Refine processes
   - Document lessons learned

### Best Practices

- Use automated tools for continuous assessment
- Implement least privilege access
- Maintain detailed audit logs
- Regular security training for pipeline teams
- Clear documentation of security controls
- Incident response procedures for pipeline issues
- Regular testing of security controls
- Change management processes

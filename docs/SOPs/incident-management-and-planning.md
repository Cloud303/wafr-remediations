#  Incident Management and Planning

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance for establishing and maintaining an effective incident management and planning program. The intended audience includes security teams, incident responders, and IT operations personnel responsible for responding to and managing security incidents.

The purpose of this SOP is to ensure the organization has proper processes, personnel, and tools in place to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. This includes identifying key roles and responsibilities, developing incident response plans and playbooks, and regularly validating security controls.

## Identify key personnel and external resources

### Overview
Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities is critical for effective incident response. The organization must identify and document key personnel, both internal and external, who will be involved in responding to security incidents.

### Key Personnel Roles

The following key roles should be defined:

- **Incident Manager**: Has overall authority during incident response
- **Incident Responders**: Responsible for investigation and remediation activities
- **Communications Lead**: Handles internal and external communications
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Provide expertise on specific systems/applications

For each role:
- Document primary and backup personnel
- Include multiple contact methods (phone, email, etc)
- Define responsibilities and authority levels
- Establish escalation paths

### External Resources

Identify and document external parties that may need to be engaged:

- AWS Support contacts and account team
- Managed security service providers
- Legal counsel
- PR/Communications firms
- Law enforcement contacts
- Industry regulators
- Forensics specialists

Maintain updated contact information and engagement procedures for all external resources.

### Implementation Guidance

1. Create and maintain a contact roster with all key personnel and external resources
2. Document roles, responsibilities and authority levels
3. Establish on-call schedules and escalation procedures
4. Regularly validate contact information accuracy
5. Conduct periodic training on roles and responsibilities
6. Include external resource engagement procedures in incident response plans
7. Consider using AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager to manage contacts and escalations

## Develop incident management plans

### Overview
Incident management plans provide the foundation and framework for responding to security incidents. Plans should document response procedures, communication protocols, and decision-making authority.

### Plan Components

Key components to include:

- Incident classification and severity definitions
- Roles and responsibilities 
- Communication and escalation procedures
- Response procedures and playbooks
- Documentation requirements
- Post-incident review process

### Plan Development

When developing plans:

1. Base on industry frameworks (NIST, ISO, etc)
2. Align with business requirements and risk tolerance
3. Consider regulatory requirements
4. Document clear decision-making authority
5. Define communication protocols
6. Include specific response procedures
7. Establish documentation standards
8. Define metrics and success criteria

### Implementation Guidance

1. Document baseline incident response plan
2. Develop specific playbooks for common scenarios
3. Define severity levels and response requirements
4. Establish communication templates and procedures
5. Create documentation standards and forms
6. Define post-incident review process
7. Regularly review and update plans
8. Train personnel on plan execution
9. Exercise plans through tabletop drills

## Regularly assess security properties of the pipelines

### Overview
The security of CI/CD pipelines is critical since they are used to build and deploy applications. Regular assessment helps ensure pipeline security controls remain effective.

### Key Assessment Areas

- Access controls and permissions
- Secret management
- Infrastructure security
- Code scanning and testing
- Deployment controls
- Monitoring and logging
- Change management

### Assessment Activities

1. Review pipeline configurations and settings
2. Validate access controls and permissions
3. Test security scanning effectiveness
4. Verify secret management practices
5. Assess infrastructure security
6. Review monitoring and alerting
7. Validate change management processes

### Implementation Guidance

1. Define pipeline security standards
2. Create assessment procedures and checklists
3. Establish regular assessment schedule
4. Document findings and track remediation
5. Review assessment results with stakeholders
6. Update standards based on findings
7. Maintain assessment records
8. Report on assessment metrics

### Best Practices

- Use infrastructure as code for pipeline configuration
- Implement least privilege access
- Enable comprehensive logging
- Use automated security testing
- Maintain separate environments
- Regular credential rotation
- Change management controls
- Monitoring and alerting

Regular assessment of pipeline security helps maintain the integrity of the software delivery process and reduces risk of compromise.

#  Cost Management and Budgeting

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines best practices for implementing effective cost management and budgeting processes for cloud resources on AWS. It is intended for finance, technology, and business leaders responsible for managing cloud costs and optimizing cloud spend. The SOP covers key areas including establishing ownership of cost optimization, creating partnerships between finance and technology teams, setting up cloud budgets and forecasts, and developing cost-related policies.

## Establish ownership of cost optimization

### Why it's important

Establishing clear ownership of cost optimization efforts is critical for driving accountability and ensuring cloud costs are actively managed across the organization. Without dedicated ownership, cost optimization initiatives often lack focus and fail to deliver sustained results.

### Implementation guidance

- Create a Cloud Business Office (CBO) or Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) team responsible for establishing and maintaining a culture of cost awareness
- The team should include key stakeholders from finance, technology, and business units
- Secure executive sponsorship to provide support and escalation paths
- Define goals and metrics for the cost optimization function, such as:
  - Creating cost optimization education programs
  - Developing organization-wide standards for cost monitoring and reporting  
  - Setting workload-level optimization targets
- Establish a regular cadence of cost optimization reviews and reporting

### Key considerations

- The function may be an individual or team depending on organization size
- A multi-disciplinary approach is needed, with skills in areas like financial analysis, data science, and cloud engineering
- The team should be measured on their ability to deliver against cost optimization goals

## Establish a partnership between finance and technology 

### Why it's important

Close collaboration between finance and technology teams is essential for effective cloud financial management. Finance teams need to understand the cloud consumption model, while technology teams need visibility into budgets and financial requirements.

### Implementation guidance

- Involve both finance and technology stakeholders in cost discussions throughout the cloud journey
- Educate finance teams on cloud pricing models, consumption-based billing, and the differences from traditional on-premises IT
- Provide technology teams with insight into budgets, financial reporting needs, and cost allocation requirements
- Establish a shared understanding of organizational goals related to cloud adoption and cost management
- Create processes for finance and technology to collaborate on activities like:
  - Forecasting future cloud spend
  - Analyzing cost variances
  - Evaluating commitment-based discounts (e.g. Reserved Instances, Savings Plans)
  - Optimizing resource allocation and usage

### Key considerations

- Cultural change may be needed to break down silos between finance and technology
- Regular touchpoints (e.g. weekly/monthly meetings) help maintain alignment
- Shared metrics and KPIs can drive collaboration

## Establish cloud budgets and forecasts

### Why it's important

Setting budgets and forecasts is crucial for maintaining control over cloud spend and avoiding unexpected costs. Unlike traditional IT, cloud costs can be highly variable, requiring new approaches to budgeting and forecasting.

### Implementation guidance

- Implement a combination of trend-based and driver-based forecasting
- Use AWS Cost Explorer for trend-based forecasting of future spend
- Identify key business drivers that impact cloud usage and costs
- Create budgets at granular levels (e.g. account, service, tag) using AWS Budgets
- Set up alerts for when actual or forecasted spend exceeds budget thresholds  
- Regularly review accuracy of forecasts and refine models
- Consider cost modeling for new workloads to set expectations

### Key considerations

- Forecasts should account for factors like seasonality, new product launches, etc.
- The level of granularity for budgets/forecasts may vary based on organizational structure
- Both fixed budgets and variable budgets tied to business metrics can be useful

## Develop policies based on your organization requirements

### Why it's important

Well-defined policies provide guardrails to govern cloud usage and spend across the organization. They help enforce standards, control access to resources, and drive cost-efficient behaviors.

### Implementation guidance

- Work with stakeholders to define policies aligned to organizational goals and requirements
- Start with broad, high-level policies and refine for specific organizational units/workloads
- Define policies around areas like:
  - Which services/features can be used
  - Allowed instance types/sizes  
  - Tagging standards
  - Approval processes for provisioning resources
- Implement policies using tools like AWS Organizations, IAM policies, and Service Control Policies
- Regularly review and update policies as business needs evolve

### Key considerations

- Policies should balance control with flexibility to innovate
- Education and communication are key for policy adoption
- Automated enforcement of policies reduces overhead

## Conclusion

Implementing robust cost management and budgeting processes is essential for optimizing cloud spend and delivering business value. By establishing clear ownership, fostering finance/technology partnerships, setting budgets/forecasts, and developing policies, organizations can create a strong foundation for cloud financial management.

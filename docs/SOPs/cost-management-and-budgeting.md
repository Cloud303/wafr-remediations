#  Cost Management and Budgeting

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides guidance on implementing effective cost management 
and budgeting practices for cloud resources. The intended audience includes finance teams, 
technology teams, and business stakeholders responsible for managing and optimizing cloud costs.

The purpose of this SOP is to establish clear processes and responsibilities around:

- Cost optimization ownership and accountability
- Finance and technology team collaboration 
- Budget planning and forecasting
- Cost governance policies and controls

Following these practices will help organizations better manage their cloud spend, improve cost 
predictability, and optimize resource utilization.

## Establish Ownership of Cost Optimization

### Purpose
Create clear accountability and ownership for cloud cost optimization across the organization by 
establishing a dedicated function responsible for managing cloud costs.

   - Technology/engineering representatives  
   - Business stakeholders
   - Executive sponsor

2. Define key responsibilities:
   - Monitor and analyze cloud spend
   - Identify cost optimization opportunities
   - Implement cost governance policies
   - Drive cost awareness across organization

   - Manage commitment-based discounts (Reserved Instances, Savings Plans)

3. Determine time allocation:
   - For small organizations: Part-time focus
   - For large enterprises: Full-time dedicated team

4. Required capabilities:
   - Project management
   - Data analysis
   - Financial analysis
   - Software/infrastructure development
   - Cloud architecture expertise

5. Establish regular cadence:
   - Review organization cost status
   - Track optimization programs

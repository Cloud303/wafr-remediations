## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the key processes and best practices for incident management and planning in an organization. It is intended for security and IT teams responsible for preparing for and responding to security incidents. The SOP covers identifying key personnel and resources, developing incident management plans, and regularly assessing security properties of pipelines and systems.

## Identify key personnel and external resources

### Why it's important

Having a clear understanding of who needs to be involved during a security incident is critical for an effective and timely response. This includes both internal staff as well as any external parties or resources that may need to be engaged.

### Implementation advice

- Maintain an up-to-date contact list of key internal personnel including:
  - Incident response team members
  - IT and security leadership 
  - Legal counsel
  - Communications/PR team
  - Relevant business unit leaders

- Identify external resources that may be needed:
  - Managed security service providers
  - Forensics firms
  - Legal counsel
  - PR firms
  - Law enforcement contacts

- Document roles and responsibilities for each contact

- Include multiple contact methods (phone, email, etc.) for each person

- Review and update the contact list regularly, at least quarterly

- Consider using a tool like PagerDuty to manage on-call rotations and notifications

- Conduct periodic tests to ensure contact information is accurate

- Provide training to ensure personnel understand their roles during an incident

### Additional considerations

- Establish clear escalation procedures 
- Define thresholds for when to engage external resources
- Consider geographic distribution of personnel for 24/7 coverage
- Ensure proper access and authorization is in place for key personnel
- Document any regulatory or compliance notification requirements

## Develop incident management plans

### Why it's important

Having predefined incident response plans allows for a more coordinated and effective response when an incident occurs. It provides a framework for decision making and helps ensure critical steps are not missed in the heat of the moment.

### Implementation advice

- Develop plans for different types of incidents:
  - Data breach
  - Malware/ransomware
  - DDoS attack
  - Insider threat
  - Physical security incident

- Include the following elements in each plan:
  - Incident classification and severity levels  
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Communication protocols
  - Containment, eradication and recovery procedures
  - Evidence preservation steps
  - Reporting requirements

- Use a consistent template across plans for uniformity

- Align plans with industry frameworks like NIST

- Review and update plans at least annually

- Conduct tabletop exercises to test plans

- Ensure plans are readily accessible to response team

- Integrate plans with other business continuity/disaster recovery plans

### Additional considerations

- Include checklists and flowcharts for quick reference
- Define thresholds for plan activation
- Document tools and resources needed to execute the plan
- Include templates for communication and status updates
- Consider plans for different impact levels and scenarios
- Ensure plans address both on-premises and cloud environments

## Regularly assess security properties of the pipelines

### Why it's important

CI/CD pipelines are a critical part of the software delivery process and can be an attractive target for attackers. Regularly assessing the security of pipelines helps identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before they can be exploited.

### Implementation advice

- Conduct regular security assessments of CI/CD pipelines:
  - Review access controls and permissions
  - Assess secrets management practices  
  - Evaluate network segmentation
  - Review logging and monitoring configuration
  - Check for vulnerable dependencies

- Implement security guardrails:
  - Enforce separation of duties
  - Require peer review of pipeline changes  
  - Implement branch protection rules
  - Use signed commits

- Scan artifacts and container images for vulnerabilities

- Use infrastructure-as-code to define and version pipeline configurations

- Implement automated compliance checks in pipelines

- Monitor pipeline activity for anomalies

- Regularly rotate access keys and credentials

- Conduct penetration testing of pipeline infrastructure 

### Additional considerations

- Evaluate security of self-hosted vs cloud-hosted pipelines
- Assess security of any third-party integrations or plugins
- Review disaster recovery plans for pipeline infrastructure
- Consider implementing chaos engineering practices
- Evaluate pipeline security in the context of overall application security
- Stay informed on emerging pipeline attack techniques

By implementing these practices, organizations can improve their incident response capabilities and reduce risk in their software delivery pipelines. Regular review and testing of these procedures is critical to ensure they remain effective as the threat landscape evolves.

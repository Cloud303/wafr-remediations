#  Incident Management and Planning.md

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the key processes and best practices for incident management and planning related to AWS workloads and environments. It is intended for security teams, incident responders, and workload owners responsible for preparing for and responding to security incidents.

The purpose of this SOP is to provide guidance on:

- Identifying key personnel and external resources needed for incident response
- Developing comprehensive incident management plans  
- Regularly assessing and improving the security properties of CI/CD pipelines

By following these practices, organizations can improve their readiness to respond to and mitigate security incidents affecting their AWS environments.

## Identify key personnel and external resources

### Why it's important

Having a clear understanding of the key personnel and external resources needed during a security incident is critical for an effective and timely response. This allows organizations to quickly engage the right people and leverage the appropriate resources when an incident occurs, rather than scrambling to identify them in the heat of the moment.

### Implementation advice

- Maintain an up-to-date list of key internal personnel, including:
  - Incident manager
  - Incident responders 
  - Communications lead
  - Subject matter experts for critical workloads

- Include contact information, roles, and responsibilities for each person

- Identify relevant external partners and resources:
  - AWS Support 
  - Managed security service providers
  - Legal counsel
  - PR/communications firms

- Document escalation procedures and approval processes

- Use AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager to capture contacts, define response plans, and create escalation paths

- Implement on-call rotations to distribute responsibility

- Regularly review and update the personnel/resource list to reflect organizational changes

- Conduct tabletop exercises to validate that the right people are included

### Additional considerations

- Ensure 24/7 coverage for critical roles
- Have backup contacts for key positions
- Include both technical and non-technical stakeholders  
- Consider geographic distribution of personnel
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive contact information

## Develop incident management plans

### Why it's important

A comprehensive incident management plan provides a structured approach for responding to security events. It ensures that the organization has predefined processes and procedures in place to detect, analyze, contain, eradicate and recover from incidents in a consistent and effective manner. Without a formal plan, responses can be disorganized, inconsistent and potentially worsen the impact of an incident.

### Implementation advice

- Create a formal incident response plan document that includes:
  - Incident response team overview and structure
  - Roles and responsibilities 
  - Communication and escalation procedures
  - Incident classification and prioritization definitions
  - Step-by-step response procedures for common incident types
  - Tools and resources available to the team

- Align the plan with relevant compliance and regulatory requirements (e.g. NIST, GDPR)

- Leverage the AWS Shared Responsibility Model to clarify security responsibilities

- Define incident severity levels and associated response times

- Document procedures for engaging AWS Support and other external resources

- Include guidance on evidence preservation and forensic investigation

- Establish processes for post-incident analysis and continuous improvement

- Regularly review and update the plan based on lessons learned

- Conduct training on the plan for all relevant personnel

### Additional considerations

- Customize plans for different types of incidents (e.g. data breach, ransomware, DDoS)
- Include both technical and non-technical (e.g. legal, PR) aspects of incident response
- Consider impacts to customers and partners in the response procedures
- Align incident management with broader business continuity plans
- Leverage automation where possible to streamline response actions

## Regularly assess security properties of the pipelines

### Why it's important

CI/CD pipelines are critical infrastructure for deploying code and changes to production environments. Ensuring the security and integrity of these pipelines is essential to prevent unauthorized changes or the introduction of vulnerabilities into production systems. Regular assessment helps identify potential weaknesses or misconfigurations before they can be exploited.

### Implementation advice

- Apply Well-Architected Security Pillar principles to pipeline infrastructure
- Implement least privilege access for pipeline components and processes
- Use IAM roles instead of long-term credentials for pipeline authentication
- Enable logging and monitoring of all pipeline activities
- Regularly review and audit pipeline configurations and permissions
- Implement safeguards to prevent deployment to unintended environments
- Use code signing to verify integrity of deployed artifacts
- Scan pipeline code and configurations for vulnerabilities
- Conduct penetration testing of pipeline infrastructure 
- Implement separation of duties between pipeline management and usage

- Use AWS services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy that integrate security best practices

- Leverage AWS IAM Access Analyzer to generate least privilege policies

- Configure Amazon EventBridge rules to detect and alert on suspicious pipeline activity

### Additional considerations

- Treat pipeline infrastructure as a critical production system
- Implement change management processes for pipeline modifications
- Regularly rotate any long-term credentials used by pipelines
- Consider using separate accounts for pipeline infrastructure
- Implement break-glass procedures for emergency pipeline access
- Conduct game day exercises to validate pipeline security controls

By focusing on these key areas - identifying personnel and resources, developing robust plans, and securing deployment pipelines - organizations can significantly improve their incident management and response capabilities for AWS environments. Regular testing and continuous improvement of these processes is essential as both threats and cloud environments evolve over time.
